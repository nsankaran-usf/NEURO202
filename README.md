# NEURO202
This is a Github repository for materials related to NEURO 202: Research Methods and Data Analysis for Cognitive Neuroscience. In contrast to NEURO 201, this one will only contain *Assignments* 
<br>
This course will primarily use Jupyter notebooks, an interactive notebook that combines live code, equations, narrative texts, and visualizations. There is no need for outside installations as we will be running them on Google Colab, you can acccess it directly through the button below

### Below are steps on showing how materials will look like and how they will be submitted in the future

Once you click on the button, the window shown below will open. Select the file you want to work on (e.g., a particular assignment or in-class coding activity). This will open the notebook. <br>

A new notebook should then open with the title "Copy of [file name]". This copy of the notebook now "lives" on your google drive, and you can now begin working on the assignment or activity by making edits to this copy of the notebook!<br>
